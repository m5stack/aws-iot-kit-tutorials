Welcome to Cloud Connected Blinky. In this tutorial, you create a "blinky" application, which is the equivalent of a [hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) exercise for microcontrollers. The "blinky" exercise demonstrates that you have established communication (telemetry) between the device and the cloud. 

Through this tutorial, you connect your device to the [AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/), send and receive [MQTT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt.html) messages, and view the messages on the device and in the AWS cloud. To accomplish this, complete the following:
- Install and configure the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on your host machine to remotely manage your AWS services and use provided helper scripts.
- Register a "[thing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-management.html)" in AWS IoT Core using the security certificates pre-provisioned on the onboard secure element.
- Configure your {{< awsService type="edukit-short-en" >}} to connect to your local Wi-Fi, connect to your AWS account's [AWS IoT endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html), and send MQTT messages to the AWS IoT Core.
- Receive an MQTT message from the cloud on the specified device to trigger blinking an LED. 
 
This tutorial requires that you have:
- The [{{< awsService type="edukit-long-en" >}}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) ({{< awsService type="edukit-short-en" >}}) device.
- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) that is *not* running production workloads.
- A user in your AWS account that is assigned to you and has administrator access.
- Completed the [Getting Started](getting-started/prerequisites.html) tutorial.
- Familiarity with basic technical concepts and tools, such as the command prompt or terminal window.


{{% notice note %}}
If you do not have an {{< awsService type="edukit-short-en" >}}, you can purchase one through [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/), or the [M5Stack store](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit) and their global distributors. If you haven't registered for an AWS account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

In this lesson, you will download and install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) for your host machine's operating system, retrieve AWS [Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) (IAM) user access credentials to manage services with the AWS CLI, configure the AWS CLI, and finally test that the AWS CLI is working properly. 

{{% notice info%}}
If you already have the AWS CLI (version 1 or version 2) installed and configured on your machine, skip to [Test the AWS CLI](#testing-the-aws-cli).

## Open the PlatformIO CLI terminal window
In the [Getting Started](../getting-started.html) tutorial, you installed and used PlatformIO (PIO) and the PIO terminal window. The PIO terminal window pre-loads additional applications and libraries that your standard terminal/command prompt might not have. It is important to continue to use the PIO terminal window for all following steps. 

If you closed Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or don't have the terminal viewport with the PlatformIO CLI displayed, complete the following steps:
1. Open **VS Code**, if necessary.
1. Choose the **PlatformIO logo** on the VS Code activity bar.
1. From the **Quick Access** menu, expand **Miscellaneous**, and select **New Terminal**. The terminal viewport should load with a new terminal labeled *PlatformIO CLI*.

## Download and install the AWS CLI
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. You can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts with just one tool. To configure the AWS CLI, you must have an AWS account. 

* If you do not have a personal AWS account, [sign in to AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) or [create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) before proceeding.
* Once complete, choose the appropriate operating system from the following list and complete the instructions to install the AWS CLI:

{{%expand "Ubuntu Linux v18.0+ (64-bit)" %}}
Issue the following commands to download and install the latest AWS CLI version 2 for 64-bit Linux:
   ```bash
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```
{{% /expand%}}

{{%expand "MacOS 10.14+" %}}
1. Download the latest [ AWS CLI version 2 installer for macOS](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg).
1. Launch the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the AWS CLI on the host machine. We recommend you install the AWS CLI for all users, but if you choose not to, follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html#cliv2-mac-install-gui) to create a symlink and add the file to your path.

1. Download the latest [AWS CLI version 2 installer for Windows](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi).
1. Launch the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the AWS CLI on your host machine.

For additional information and instructions, see [Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

## Retrieve the IAM user access credentials
[AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. As a best practice, we recommend to [create an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html) instead of using your root user account.

To retrieve your IAM user's access credentials, follow the instructions outlined in the [Quick configuration with aws configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config) documentation.

## Configure the AWS CLI
With the AWS CLI installed and the IAM user access credentials in hand, it's time to configure the AWS CLI. 

One of the settings you will configure is the [AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html). Keep in mind that the Region you're currently using stays consistent. For purposes of this tutorial, we use `us-west-2` as the standard Region. Using a different Region or unknowingly changing Regions can cause other challenges in subsequent steps, including [regional service availability](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).

Issue the following command in the terminal viewport to configure the AWS CLI on your host machine:
```bash
aws configure
```

The CLI prompts you to input four parameters. Complete the information similar to the following example. 
**Note:** The AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key must match the information that you retrieved for your IAM user. 

- AWS Access Key ID [None]: `EXAMPLEKEYIDEXAMPLE`
- AWS Secret Access Key [None]: `EXAMPLEtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`
- Default region name [None]: `us-west-2`
- Default output format [None]: `json`

## Test the AWS CLI
With the AWS CLI configured, it is time to test that everything is configured correctly. Let's begin with a simple test. Run the following command to confirm the AWS CLI version that's installed:

```bash
aws --version
```

If you receive errors, see [Troubleshooting AWS CLI errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-troubleshooting.html).
{{% /notice %}}

Next, verify that the AWS CLI is configured with your IAM credentials and is using the us-west-2 (US West (Oregon)) Region. Run the following command to check your [MQTT broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html) endpoint for AWS IoT. 
```bash
aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS
```
It should return an address with the pattern `xxxxxxxx-ats.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`. Take a moment to copy and paste the endpoint to a secure location. If you receive an error, see the troubleshooting guide mentioned previously on this page.

Now that everything is installed and configured, continue to the next lesson, [**Device Provisioning**](device-provisioning.html).

## What is Alexa Voice Service (AVS)?
The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) enables developers to turn just about any connected device into an Alexa device! AVS software integrates directly into products and provides the ability to add the Alexa voice assistant. AVS provides developers with access to a suite of resources to build Alexa-enabled products, including APIs, hardware development kits, software development kits, and documentation.

## What is Alexa Voice Service Integration for AWS IoT (AFI)?
Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Integration is a new feature of AWS IoT Core that enables device makers to make any connected device an Alexa Built-in device. AVS for AWS IoT reduces both the cost and complexity of producing Alexa Built-in devices by offloading compute and memory intensive tasks from physical devices to the cloud. With the reduction in the engineering bill of materials (eBoM) cost, device makers can now cost-effectively build new categories of differentiated voice-enabled products such as light switches, thermostats, small appliances and more.

## Let's go!
All content in this tutorial assumes you presently have the [M5Stack Core2 ESP32 IoT Development Kit for AWS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) in your possession, a compatible iOS or Android smart phone to use the Amazon Alexa app and ESP Alexa Phone Application, and are comfortable with basic technical concepts and tools—such as the command prompt/terminal. Purchase a reference hardware kit from one of the [global distribution options](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/edukit/#Get_started_with_AWS_IoT_EduKit) if you don't have one already.

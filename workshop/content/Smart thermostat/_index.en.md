In this tutorial, you configure your {{< awsService type="edukit-short-en" >}} to simulate a smart thermostat that controls a fictional HVAC system. Your smart thermostat reports the measured room temperature and noise level to its [device shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html) in the cloud. You also configure a serverless application that listens for the reported temperatures, determines the state to set the thermostat, and sends commands back to the device. 

This tutorial requires that you have:
- The [{{< awsService type="edukit-long-en" >}}](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) ({{< awsService type="edukit-short-en" >}}) device.
- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) that is *not* running production workloads.
- A user in your AWS account that is assigned to you and has administrator access.
- Completed the [Cloud Connected Blinky](/en/blinky-hello-world.html) tutorial.
- Confirmed which serial port the device uses.
- Familiarity with basic technical concepts and tools, such as the command prompt or terminal window.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
1. Acquire temperature and sound levels from the {{< awsService type="edukit-short-en" >}}.
1. Publish temperature and sound measurements from the {{< awsService type="edukit-short-en" >}} to AWS IoT Core.
1. Report measured values to the AWS IoT device shadow.
1. Perform message transformations with the AWS IoT rules engine.
1. Build a serverless application that responds to inputs and detects complex events.
1. Send commands to your device through the device shadow.

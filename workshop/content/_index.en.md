AWS IoT EduKit is an easy way to learn how to build Internet of Things (IoT) applications using AWS services through a prescriptive learning program. Students, engineers, and professionals benefit from hands-on practice with the AWS IoT EduKit. These educational resources combine a reference hardware kit with detailed guides and code examples to build IoT applications.

### Benefits of AWS IoT EduKit
#### Simplified hardware selection
AWS IoT EduKit’s reference hardware kit is made and sold by our manufacturing partner, [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/), and packed with onboard features so that you can easily create IoT applications straight out of the box. Developers can broaden the device's capabilities to cover additional use-cases with plug and play expansion options.

The reference hardware kit provides powerful and secure hardware to build a range of IoT applications at an affordable price. The AWS IoT EduKit is powered by an Espressif ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU) and coupled with a Microchip ATECC608 Trust&GO secure element. It is Alexa capable and comes with multiple on-board peripherals. There are a wide range of expansion modules sold separately to provide additional connectivity (such as, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, LTE). There are also plug and play grove-connector peripherals (such as, sensors and actuators) to cover additional use-cases.

#### Supports a wide range of software frameworks
AWS IoT EduKit’s reference hardware supports a wide range of application frameworks (such as, FreeRTOS, Arduino, MicroPython) that allow developers to code in their preferred programming language and progress quickly to build cloud-connected, embedded applications on a single hardware platform.

AWS IoT EduKit simplifies on-boarding to AWS IoT through through Espressif's ESP RainMaker platform and PlatformIO development platform. The ESP RainMaker platform allows developers to control the reference hardware kit and the smart home application without an AWS account. Finally, the PlatformIO development platform simplifies embedded development to quickly view, edit, and flash code.

#### Easy access to Sample Code
AWS IoT EduKit provides up-to-date content and example code to the most common IoT solutions. Developers can access free content to gain expertise to build and manage IoT applications using AWS services through the AWS IoT EduKit [tutorials](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html),

### How it works
To begin, purchase your reference hardware kit from [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) (US), [M5Stack store](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit) (CN/Global), [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/m5stack-technology-co-ltd/K010-AWS/13562927) (AMER/Global), [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/M5Stack/K010-AWS?qs=%2Fha2pyFaduh2vnlTOLWOXVDYhV94RvwKuua4BUEreQw%3D) (AMER/Global), [Switch Science](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/6784/) (JP), or [Distrelec](https://www.distrelec.biz/en/esp32-m5core2-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit-m5stack-k010-aws/p/30196462) (EU).

Once you receive the hardware kit, access the [getting started tutorial](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html) and follow the steps in the prerequisite section to install the ESP RainMaker Agent firmware on the device and the ESP RainMaker Mobile App on your mobile phone. The ESP RainMaker Mobile App will allow you to control the AWS IoT EduKit reference hardware and connect to AWS IoT. 

Next, select from a list of free projects that are available on AWS IoT EduKit's website. Start with building a basic connected home application and progress to running a machine learning model with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot. Other projects build a Voice Assisted Smart Home application with Alexa Voice Service Integration for AWS IoT (AFI). To learn more about the hardware specifications, see the [M5Stack Docs](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/core/core2_for_aws) or [Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000007djMLEAY).

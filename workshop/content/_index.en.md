{{<awsEdukitLong-en>}} is an easy way to learn how to build IoT applications using AWS services through a prescriptive learning program. {{<awsEdukitShort-en>}} helps developers – from students to experienced engineers and professionals – receive hands-on experience building end-to-end IoT applications by combining a reference hardware kit with a set of easy to follow guides and example code.

AWS IoT EduKit is an easy way to learn how to build Internet of Things (IoT) applications using AWS services through a prescriptive learning program. Students, engineers, and professionals benefit from hands-on practice with the AWS IoT EduKit. These educational resources combine a reference hardware kit with detailed guides and code examples to build IoT applications.

### Benefits of {{<awsEdukitShort-en>}}
#### Simplified hardware selection
- {{<awsEdukitShort-en>}}’s reference hardware kit – made and sold by our manufacturing partner, M5Stack – is packed with onboard features to enable a multitude of IoT applications out of the box Developers can broaden their capabilities to cover additional use-cases with plug & play expansion options.
- The reference hardware kit provides powerful and secure hardware to build a range of IoT applications (entry level to advanced/professional) at an entry level price tag. It is powered by an Espressif ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU), coupled with a Microchip ATECC608 Trust&GO secure element. It is Alexa capable, comes with multiple on-board peripherals, a wide range of separately available expansion modules for additional connectivity options (e.g. LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, LTE) and plug & play grove-connector peripherals (e.g. sensors, actuators) to cover a wider breadth of use-cases.

#### Supports a wide range of software frameworks
- {{<awsEdukitShort-en>}}’s reference hardware supports a wide range of application frameworks (e.g. FreeRTOS, Arduino, MicroPython) which allows developers to code in the language of their choice and progress in building cloud connected embedded applications on a single hardware platform.
- {{<awsEdukitShort-en>}} simplifies on-boarding to AWS IoT through through Espressif's RainMaker platform and PlatformIO development platform. The Espressif RainMaker platform allows you to control the reference hardware kit and control the smart home application without an AWS account. The PlatformIO development platform simplifies embedded development to quickly view, edit, and flash code.

#### Easy access to Sample Code
- {{<awsEdukitShort-en>}} provides up-to-date content and example code to the most common IoT solutions.
- Through {{<awsEdukitShort-en>}} [tutorials](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html), developers can access a variety of free content to gain expertise in building and managing IoT applications using AWS services.

AWS IoT EduKit’s reference hardware kit is made and sold by our manufacturing partner, [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/), and packed with onboard features so that you can easily create IoT applications straight out of the box. Developers can broaden the device's capabilities to cover additional use-cases with plug and play expansion options.

The ESP RainMaker platform allows developers to control the reference hardware kit and the smart home application without an AWS account. Finally, the PlatformIO development platform simplifies embedded development to quickly view, edit, and flash code.

#### Easy access to Sample Code
AWS IoT EduKit provides up-to-date content and example code to the most common IoT solutions. Developers can access free content to gain expertise to build and manage IoT applications using AWS services through the AWS IoT EduKit [tutorials](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html),

### How it works
To begin, purchase your reference hardware kit from [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) (US), [M5Stack store](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit) (CN/Global), [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/m5stack-technology-co-ltd/K010-AWS/13562927) (AMER/Global), [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/M5Stack/K010-AWS?qs=%2Fha2pyFaduh2vnlTOLWOXVDYhV94RvwKuua4BUEreQw%3D) (AMER/Global), [Switch Science](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/6784/) (JP), or [Distrelec](https://www.distrelec.biz/en/esp32-m5core2-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit-m5stack-k010-aws/p/30196462) (EU).

Once you receive the hardware kit, access the [getting started tutorial](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html) and follow the steps in the prerequisite section to install the ESP RainMaker Agent firmware on the device and the ESP RainMaker Mobile App on your mobile phone. The ESP RainMaker Mobile App will allow you to control the AWS IoT EduKit reference hardware and connect to AWS IoT.

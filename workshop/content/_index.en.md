{{< awsService type="kit-long-en" >}} ({{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}}) is an easy way to learn how to build Internet of Things (IoT) applications using AWS services through a prescriptive learning program. Students, engineers, and professionals benefit from hands-on practice with the {{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}}. These educational resources combine a device with detailed guides and code examples to build IoT applications.

### Benefits of {{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}}
#### Simplified hardware selection 
The {{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}} device is made and sold by our manufacturing partner, [M5Stack](https://m5stack.com/), and packed with onboard features, so that you can easily create IoT applications straight out of the box. Developers can broaden the device's capabilities to cover additional use cases with plug and play expansion options.

The device provides powerful and secure hardware to build a range of IoT applications at an affordable price. The {{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}} is powered by an Espressif ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU) and coupled with a Microchip ATECC608 Trust&GO secure element. It is Alexa capable and comes with multiple on-board peripherals. There are a wide range of expansion modules sold separately to provide additional connectivity (such as LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and LTE). There are also plug and play grove-connector peripherals (such as sensors and actuators) to cover additional use-cases.

#### Supports a wide range of software frameworks
The {{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}} device supports a wide range of application frameworks (such as FreeRTOS, Arduino, and MicroPython) that allow developers to code in their preferred programming language and progress quickly to build cloud-connected, embedded applications on a single hardware platform.

{{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}} simplifies onboarding to AWS IoT through through Espressif's ESP RainMaker and PlatformIO development platforms. The ESP RainMaker platform lets developers control the device and the smart home application without an AWS account. The PlatformIO development platform simplifies embedded development to quickly view, edit, and flash code.

#### Easy access to sample code
{{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}} provides up-to-date content and example code to the most common IoT solutions. Developers can access free content to gain expertise to build and manage IoT applications using AWS services through the {{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}} [tutorials](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html),

### How it works
To begin, purchase your {{< awsService type="kit-long-en" >}} from [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VGRZYJR/) (US), [M5Stack store](https://m5stack.com/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit) (CN/Global), [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/m5stack-technology-co-ltd/K010-AWS/13562927) (AMER/Global), [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/M5Stack/K010-AWS?qs=%2Fha2pyFaduh2vnlTOLWOXVDYhV94RvwKuua4BUEreQw%3D) (AMER/Global), [Switch Science](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/6784/) (JP), or [Distrelec](https://www.distrelec.biz/en/esp32-m5core2-iot-development-kit-for-aws-iot-edukit-m5stack-k010-aws/p/30196462) (EU).

Once you receive the hardware kit, access the [getting started tutorial](https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/getting-started.html) and follow the steps in the Prerequisites lesson to install the ESP RainMaker Agent firmware on the device, and the ESP RainMaker Mobile App on your mobile phone. The ESP RainMaker Mobile App will allow you to control the {{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}} and connect to AWS IoT. 

Next, select from a list of free projects on {{< awsService type="kit-short-en" >}}'s website. Begin with building a basic connected home application, and progress to running a machine learning model with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot. Other projects let you build a Voice Assisted Smart Home application with Alexa Voice Service Integration for AWS IoT (AFI). To learn more about the hardware specifications, see the [M5Stack Docs](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/core/core2_for_aws) or [Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com/detail/a3G0h000007djMLEAY).
